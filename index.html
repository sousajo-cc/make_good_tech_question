<h1>How to make a (better) technical question</h1>

<li><b>Context</b> Please sum up what you already did. What you tried. The command that you used, the error message, and path to the full logs.</li>
<hr>
<li><b>No Screenshot only questions</b> While screenshots might help and give some context to the question, please remember one cannot copy text from them.</li>
<hr>
<li><b>Readability</b> Use markdown. Makes the question/example more readable and easy to reason about.</li>
<hr>
<li><b>No environment assumptions</b> Post full commands. People are not familiar with your aliases and .bashrc, and if you do rely on some local environment assumptions please mention those and how should they be <em>reproduced</em></li>
<hr>
<li><b>Create a minimal reproducible example</b> If one manages to do it, it really helps to narrow down the source of the problem.</li>
<hr>
<li><b>Search for similar questions</b> It might actually also work for you and solve your problem.</li>
<hr>
<li><b>Is this the right forum?</b> Pose that question to yourself. Asking for help on a C++ issue on <a href="https://movies.stackexchange.com/">movies.stackexchange</a> might not be ideal.</li>
